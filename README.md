# 📌 Jira for Software Project Management

## 🔹 What is Jira?
**Jira** is an industry-standard project management and issue-tracking tool widely used by software teams to plan, track, and manage work using **Agile and Scrum methodologies**. It enables teams to break requirements into actionable tasks, collaborate efficiently, and monitor project progress using real-time reports and dashboards.

## 🔹 Use Case
This repository demonstrates the use of **Jira for managing a hypothetical software development project – TravelEase**, following real-world Agile practices such as sprint planning, issue tracking, collaboration, and performance analysis.

## 🚀 What I Implemented & Learned

### ✅ Project Setup
- Created a **Scrum-based Jira project**
- Configured project details, roles, and access permissions
- Used standard Jira issue types: **Epic, Story, Task, Bug, Sub-task**
- Worked with Agile workflows (**To Do → In Progress → Done**)

---

### ✅ Agile Planning (Scrum)
- Decomposed requirements into **Epics → Stories → Sub-tasks**
- Planned work using **multiple sprints**
- Defined clear **Sprint Goals**
- Applied **story point estimation (Fibonacci: 2, 3, 5)** for sprint planning

---

### ✅ Issue Management
- Created and managed:
  - User stories
  - Tasks and sub-tasks
  - Bugs and feature requests
- Assigned issues to team members
- Managed priorities at the story level
- Updated issue statuses to reflect real-time progress

---

### ✅ Collaboration
- Used **comments and @mentions** for team communication
- Linked related issues (e.g., **Bug ↔ Story**) to maintain traceability
- Added **watchers** to keep stakeholders informed
- Attached files and screenshots to issues

---

### ✅ Sprint Execution & Tracking
- Started and completed sprints following Scrum practices
- Moved incomplete work to subsequent sprints
- Tracked work using the **Scrum Board**
- Handled real-world scenarios such as **scope changes during an active sprint**

---

### ✅ Reporting & Analysis
- Analyzed **Sprint Burndown Charts** to monitor progress
- Generated and interpreted **Velocity Charts** after sprint completion
- Evaluated sprint health, workload distribution, and team capacity

---

### ✅ Dashboard Creation
- Created a **custom Jira dashboard** including:
  - Sprint Burndown Gadget
  - Issue Statistics (grouped by status)
  - Assigned-to-me gadget
- Used dashboards for centralized project monitoring

---

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Agile & Scrum methodology
- Sprint planning and execution
- Issue lifecycle management
- Team collaboration using Jira
- Project reporting and performance analysis
- Hands-on Jira project management

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of how **real-world software teams use Jira** to manage projects end-to-end — from requirement breakdown and sprint planning to collaboration, tracking, and performance analysis.
