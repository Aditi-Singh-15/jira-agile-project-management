# 📌 Jira for Software Project Management

## 🔹 What is Jira?
**Jira** is an industry-standard project management and issue-tracking tool widely used by software teams to plan, track, and manage work using **Agile and Scrum methodologies**. It helps teams organize tasks, collaborate efficiently, and monitor project progress through reports and dashboards.
